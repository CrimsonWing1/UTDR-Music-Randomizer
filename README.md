# UTDR-Music-Randomizer
A simple program to randomize the audio files for Undertale and Deltarune. Generates cursed content.
## How to Use
1) Locate your base install folder for Undertale or Deltarune.
2) Choose your preferred options (described below)
3) Click randomize
4) Enjoy the chaos!
## Options
* Include cyber.ogg and mansion.ogg — Only applies to Deltarune. Excluded by default because editing these songs can affect gameplay.
* Include cyber_battle_prelude.ogg — Only applies to Deltarune. May softlock if the replacement song is shorter than the original.
* Include Your Best Nightmare + Finale — Only applies to Undertale. Excluded by default since these songs are split into multiple files.
* Include credits songs — Adds "Bring It In, Guys!", "Last Goodbye", "Don't Forget", and "Until Next Time" to the rotation.
* Include ambience — Adds ambient sounds to the rotation (birds chirping, wind SFX, etc.)
* Include jingles and sound effects — Adds sound effects and short songs to the rotation. May sound REALLY bad.
